You want to contribute to i40-aas? Welcome! Please read this document to understand what you can do:
 * [Analyze Issues](#analyze-issues)

 * [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)
 * [Reporting Security Issues](#reporting-security-issues)
 * [Contributor License Agreement Acceptance](#contributor-license-agreement-acceptance)

## Analyze Issues
Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome!
Go to [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/SAP/i40-aas/issues?state=open) and find an open issue which needs additional work or a bugfix. Maybe you can even find and [contribute](#contribute-code) a bugfix?

## Issue Handling Process
When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "approved" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. Approved issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes. An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.

## Contribute Code
You are welcome to contribute code to i40-aas in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and report it not in the public issue tracker, but directly to us, so we can fix it before it can be exploited.

## Contributor License Agreement Acceptance
When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else), you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to i40-aas itself.
In particular you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement,
which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8).
(This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company). If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

### Company Contributors
If employees of a company contribute code, in **addition** to the individual agreement mentioned above, one company agreement must be submitted. This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill in, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](/SAP%20CCLA.pdf) form and then proceed with one of the following options:

- Scan and e-mail it to [opensource@sap.com](mailto:opensource@sap.com) and [openui5@sap.com](mailto:openui5@sap.com)
- Fax it to: +49 6227 78-45813
- Send it by traditional letter to:  
  *Industry Standards & Open Source Team*  
  *Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16*  
  *69190 Walldorf*  
  *Germany*

The form contains a list of employees who are authorized to contribute on behalf of your company. When this list changes, please let us know.
