## FAQs

### Q: Is it preferable to run i40-aas using docker-compose or Kubernetes?
A: Both work. If you have the option to do so, leverage the Helm chart to deploy __i40-aas__ to Kubernetes as it allows for easier configuration, maintenance and allows to leverage monitoring/logging capabilities cloud providers.
