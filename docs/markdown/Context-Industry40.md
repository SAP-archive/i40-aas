## Context - Industry 4.0

The implementation of the AAS-Service is related to the [Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) activities being driven by working groups in Germany. Especially the working group [Reference Architectures, Standards, and Norms](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/ThePlatform/PlatformWorkingGroups/Reference-Architectures-Standards-Norms/reference-architectures-standards-norms.html) has defined a reference architecture and a [specification](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/2018-details-of-the-asset-administration-shell.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) to address a challenging topic to hardware and software vendors: __interoperability__. Especially the integration of assets (devices, machines, software, documents, etc.) into business processes is always cumbersome, time-consuming, and usually costly. This service is meant to simplify the integration processes, and has further potential to extend existing applications.
