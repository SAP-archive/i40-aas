## Main Features
The AAS-Service provides an implementation of the RAMI 4.0 reference  architecture as specified by [Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.zvei.org/themen/industrie-40/details-of-the-asset-administration-shell/). Main features include:

- Standardized and secure communication interfaces and API to access Asset Administration Shells of the digital representation of a physical asset (Digital Twin), that enable:
  - use of a single AAS information model
  - secure access to asset information from cloud and edge
  - integration of assets without a communication interface (i.e. passive), e.g. via barcodes or QR-codes pointing to asset       management solutions

- Facilitate Interoperability:
  - The AAS-Service can act as a mediator between assets and applications that use different languages/standards
  - Enable interactions between administration shells based on semantic protocols [(VDI/VDE 2193-1)]()
  - Information in the AAS can be exchanged between all
  partners in a value chain (e.g. system manufacturers, operators, engineering and service partners, system integrators)

- Provide registry and discovery services that:
  -  hold digital models of various aspects [submodels]() that describe the technical functionality exposed by the asset
  -  implement endpoint handling for communication
  -  unambiguously identify an asset in network

- Easy implementation of complex business scenarios that support an asynchronous communication among AAS-enabled assets and applications (see [skills]()).

- Enable integration of applications (eg. Asset stores, datalake) through [application adapters]()

- [Deploy everywhere]() (cloud, on-premise, edge) providing a simple developer experience with docker and K8s

## Context - Industry 4.0
This implementation is related to the [Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) activities being driven by working groups in Germany. Especially the working group [Reference Architectures, Standards, and Norms](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/ThePlatform/PlatformWorkingGroups/Reference-Architectures-Standards-Norms/reference-architectures-standards-norms.html) has defined a reference architecture and a [specification](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/2018-details-of-the-asset-administration-shell.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) to address a challenging topic to hardware and software vendors: __interoperability__. Especially the integration of assets (devices, machines, software, documents, etc.) into business processes is always cumbersome, time-consuming, and usually costly. As shown in the following figure, this service is meant to simplify the integration processes, and has further potential to extend existing applications.

| *SAP's AAS Service as Integrator and Enabler for Interoperability - representation based on RAMI 4.0* |

This service is orchestrated in containers and can be deployed anywhere, where clusters or minimal computing power can be provided, and docker containers can be composed.



## Prerequisites
You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Docker Compose comes with Docker if you're on Mac or Windows ([check here for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)). Check the installation by executing:
```bash
$ docker --version
## tested with: 19.03.8

$ docker-compose version
## tested with: 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
```

For easier usage, install Make and verify as follows:
```bash
$ make --version
## tested with: GNU Make 3.81
```

Optionally, you can download and install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to [test the services](docs/markdown/test.md).



## Instructions
### Getting Started
Service interactions can be deployed, tested and developed locally using Docker Compose as described below. For further instructions & information about __i40-aas__ check [the documentation](docs/README.md)

Setup locally:
```bash
## Option 1
## Use images from Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/orgs/sapi40/repositories)
$ make install

## Option 2
## Build & use images from this repository via Compose file extension
## ref.:
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#image
$ make && make dev
```

### Cleanup
Once done, one can stop & clean up locally by executing:
```bash
$ make clean
```



## Configuration
The local setup uses the default configurations specified in the `.env` file.

See [here](docs/markdown/join-containers.md) how to join other service containers locally.

## Upcoming Changes
<!--- Details on any expected changes in later versions. If your project is released "as-is", or you know of no upcoming changes, this section can be omitted. --->
This project follows the specification ["Details of the AssetAdministrationShell"](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/2018-details-of-the-asset-administration-shell.html) part 1 version 1.0, which is work in progress. As the specification changes, so will this project.
