## Description
This implementation is related to the [Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) activities being driven by working groups in Germany. Especially the working group [Reference Architectures, Standards, and Norms](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/ThePlatform/PlatformWorkingGroups/Reference-Architectures-Standards-Norms/reference-architectures-standards-norms.html) has defined a reference architecture and a [specification](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/2018-details-of-the-asset-administration-shell.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) to address a challenging topic to hardware and software vendors: __interoperability__. Especially the integration of assets (devices, machines, software, documents, etc.) into business processes is always cumbersome, time-consuming, and usually costly. As shown in the following figure, this service is meant to simplify the integration processes, and has further potential to extend existing applications.

| *SAP's AAS Service as Integrator and Enabler for Interoperability - representation based on RAMI 4.0* |

This service is orchestrated in containers and can be deployed anywhere, where clusters or minimal computing power can be provided, and docker containers can be composed.



## Prerequisites
You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Docker Compose comes with Docker if you're on Mac or Windows ([check here for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)). Check the installation by executing:
```bash
$ docker --version
## tested with: 19.03.8

$ docker-compose version
## tested with: 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
```

For easier usage, install Make and verify as follows:
```bash
$ make --version
## tested with: GNU Make 3.81
```

Optionally, you can download and install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to [test the services](docs/markdown/test.md).



## Instructions
### Getting Started
Service interactions can be deployed, tested and developed locally using Docker Compose as described below. For further instructions & information about __i40-aas__ check [the documentation](docs/README.md)

Setup locally:
```bash
## Option 1
## Use images from Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/orgs/sapi40/repositories)
$ make install

## Option 2
## Build & use images from this repository via Compose file extension
## ref.:
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#image
$ make && make dev
```

### Cleanup
Once done, one can stop & clean up locally by executing:
```bash
$ make clean
```



## Configuration
The local setup uses the default configurations specified in the `.env` file.

See [here](docs/markdown/join-containers.md) how to join other service containers locally.
