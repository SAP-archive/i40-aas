# Description

This implementation is related to the [Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) activities being driven by working groups in Germany. Especially the working group [Reference Architectures, Standards, and Norms](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/ThePlatform/PlatformWorkingGroups/Reference-Architectures-Standards-Norms/reference-architectures-standards-norms.html) has defined a reference architecture and a [specification](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/2018-details-of-the-asset-administration-shell.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) to address a challenging topic to hardware and software vendors: __interoperability__. Especially the integration of assets (devices, machines, software, documents, etc.) into business processes is always cumbersome, time-consuming, and usually costly. As shown in the following figure, this service is meant to simplify the integration processes, and has further potential to extend existing applications.

| *SAP's AAS Service as Integrator and Enabler for Interoperability - representation based on RAMI 4.0* |

This service is orchestrated in containers and can be deployed anywhere, where clusters or minimal computing power can be provided, and docker containers can be composed.


# Requirements

You need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its packagemanager NPM.

Enter `node --version` and `npm --version` in your command line to test your installation.
You should see:

```
$ node --version
// min version: v8.12.0

$ npm --version
// min version: 6.4.1
```

You need to download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to manage containers and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which comes with Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows ([check here for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).

Enter `docker --version` in your command line to test your installation.
Your should see:

```
$ docker --version
// for example: Docker version 19.03.2, build 6a30dfc

$ docker-compose version
// for example: docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```

Additionally, you can download and install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test the services.

# Download and Installation

Service interactions can be tested and developed locally using Docker Compose.

1. Open a terminal and go into the project folders root directory

2. Initiate the download or build of the docker images and subsequent creation of containers (can take some minutes)

```bash
## Option 1
## Use images from Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/orgs/sapi40/repositories)
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up



## Option 2
## Build & use images from this repository via Compose file extension
## ref.:
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/
##  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#image
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

3. If you want to test the running service follow [these](docs/README_Test.md#Test) steps.

4. _CTRL+C_ stops running services in the terminal where docker-compose up has been initiated. In case this does not work, or you change some configs, run:
```
docker-compose down
```
Or kill all containers:
```bash
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```


Refer to [this](docs/README_Minikube.md) how to run the AAS Service on a local cluster (e.g. Minikube).

# Configuration

The local setup uses the configurations in the folder [.compose-envs/](.compose-envs/).

See [here](docs/README_Network.md) how to join service containers locally.

We have included minimalistic instances of popular opensource services for a message broker and for database persistance in some parts.
These can freely be replaced by any other service of your choosing or a different configuration of those same services as long as they deliver the same functionality and adhere to the internal API.
